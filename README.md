## Web Development Intern:

### Task 1: Develop an Expense/Money Tracker web-app (add as many features you need)

## 💼 Expense/Money Tracker

### 📚 Overview

The Expense/Money Tracker (Personal Finance Manager) is a web application that helps users track their income and expenses. Users can log transactions, categorize them as income or expenses, and view the total balance. The application also saves data in localStorage, ensuring persistence across sessions.

### ✨ Features

➕ Add transactions with date, amount, and type (income/expense).
❌ Delete transactions and update total balance dynamically.
🛠️ Persistent data storage using localStorage.
📲 Responsive UI for mobile and desktop devices.

### 💻 Technologies Used

- **HTML**: Structure of the web application.
- **CSS**: Styling using a responsive design approach.
- **JavaScript**: Handles functionality and localStorage management.

### ⚙️ Installation & Usage

1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/Kiran20040329/Brainwave_Matrix_Intern/tree/main
   ```
2. Open `ExpenceLogin.html` in a web browser.

### 📁 File Structure

```

│── ExpenseLogin.html      # login UI file
      │── Tracker.html       # Tracker UI file
      │── Tracker.css        # Tracker style file
